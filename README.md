I am a passionate technology enthusiast living in Savannah, GA, working for Bryan County Schools where I have just recently completed my first rotation around the sun as the Network Engineer. I'm currently dabbling in automation utilizing Ansible, and have successfully implemented flows that increase my productivity including backing-up network appliances, pushing patches to nodes used for monitoring and logging aforementioned appliances, and some smaller useful scripts to find end user devices with just a MAC address or IP address.
